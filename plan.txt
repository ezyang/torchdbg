- how to get at source code problem
  - simplifying assumption: run the server colocated with the actual files
  - more portable: package the source code with the visualization (kind of
    blegh, in general this would take up a lot of space in the trace).
    Note: just PyTorch source checkout is 1G of files!
    - could try to only selectively package files that are needed
  - client-server architecture

- trace granularity problem
  - sys.settrace
  - torch function mode
  - torch dispatch mode
    - these seem most practical: debugger glosses over details on user code
      and just jumps you from line to line that has an actual operator call
    - looking for a specific stack frame also minimizes the source code to
      ship


- priority: multiple stack levels seems really helpful (next vs step)
